## Chapter Review

1. ~~A. OpenVAS~~ Vuln scanner that lacks a GUI D. Nikto
2. ~~D. CVSS~~ B. Security Content Automation Protocol defines the manner in which security software communicates information about flaws and security configurations. It plays no role in prioritization of remediation. The Common Vulnerability Scoring
3. ~~C. Governance~~ B. TLA's - Memorandums of Understanding, SLA's organizational governance, business process interruptions, and degradation of functionality are all important factors that could delay remediation
4. ~~C. False positives are more problematic for smaller orgs~~ - D. False positives typically result in wasted resources because they have to be manually investigated to ensure they are not real issues
5. All of the following might account for the sudden drop in vulnerabilities on October 11 except which? ~~A. The team decided to prioritize remediation by difficulty of implementation~~ D. The team decided to prioritize remediation by criticality. The drop in critical vulnerabilities between the last two scans was only 56 (for a 44 percent improvement), compared to a drop of 615 (or 73 percent) in high vulnerabilities and 188 (or 67 percent) in medium vulnerabilities. The greater drops in less-critical vulnerabilities makes it less likely that focus was on criticality
6. C. Prioritize remediation by difficulty of implementation
7. B. The vulnerabilities exist in servers that are needed for mission-critical business processes
8. ~~A. Software Security Patches~~ C. Vulnerability scanners are periodically updated to respond to newly discovered vulnerabilities. These tools can also be calibrated or tuned to change the rate of false positives, though this process can sometimes blind the scanner to real vulnerabilities
9. A. Validating the logic of the checks against your IT environment
10. ~~B. Compare them to best practices~~ C. If you are unable to reduce false-positive rates, one option is simply to prioritize other results higher in terms of taking action. Over time, analysts become adept at identifying the likely false positives and could just move them to the bottom of the queue. The risk in doing this is that, unless you are certain the the result is unimportant, you risk deferring a real issue indefinitely.
11. B. Implementing an SLA for your org
12. ~~C. Keep them for regulatory compliance~~ D. Trend analysis improves context and allows your security response team to tailor its threat mitigation strategies to its efforts more efficiently. Depending on your specific organization's regulatory environment, you may be required to keep some of these reports. However, because this is not universally  true, keeping the reports for regulatory compliance is not the best answer.
