# IMPLEMENTING VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT PROCESS

1. Like many other areas in life, vulnerability management involves a combination of things we want to do, things we should do, and things we have to do.
2. A regulatory environment is an environment in which an organization exists or operates that is controlled to a significant degree by laws, rules, or regulations put in place by government (federal, state, or local), industry groups, or other organizations.
3. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO, despite the apparent discrepancy in the order of the initials) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) jointly maintain a number of standards, including 27001, which covers Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). ISO/IEC 27001 is arguably the most popular voluntary security standard in the world and covers every important aspect of developing and maintaining good information security.
4. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) applies to any organization involved in processing credit card payments using cards branded by the five major issuers (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB).
5. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) establishes penalties (ranging from $100 to $1.5 million) for covered entities that fail to safeguard protected health information (PHI).
6. In fact, this aspect of security is so important that it is prominently featured at the top of the Center for Internet Security’s (CIS’s) Critical Security Controls (CSC). CSC #1 is the inventory of authorized and unauthorized devices, and CSC #2 deals with the software running on those devices.
7. The IEEE 802.1X standard provides port-based Network Access Control (NAC) for both wired and wireless devices. With 802.1X, any client wishing to connect to the network must first authenticate itself. With that authentication, you can provide very granular access controls and even require the endpoint to satisfy requirements for patches/upgrades.
