# CHAPTER 8 - DETERMINING THE IMPACT OF INCIDENTS

The alternative is to use a solution that looks at what the file is doing, rather than what it looks like. This kind of system relies on heuristic analysis to observe the commands the executable invokes, the files it writes, and any attempts to conceal itself.

Advanced persistent threats, regardless of affiliation, are characterized by resourcing, consistency, and a military-like efficiency during their actions to compromise systems, steal data, and cover their tracks.

Having a sense of what the key performance indicators (KPIs) are for detection and remediation will clear up confusion, manage expectations, and potentially allow you to demonstrate how prepared your team is should you exceed these guidelines.

## Chapter Review

1. Describe zero day:
   A. it is a flaw in a piece of software of which the vendor is unaware
   B. The code written to take advantage of a flaw that is unknown to its vendor or users
2. APTs are best exemplified by which of the following:
   A. Nation-state adversaries
3. All of the following are factors contributing to a determination of the scope of impact of an incident except which?
   C. Uptime
4. Of the following types of data, which is likeliest to require notification of government entities if it is compromised, lest your organization incur fines or jail sentences?
   B. PHI (Personal Health information)
5. All of the following are types of protected IP except which?
   D. Items covered by the “fair use” doctrine
6. What makes information about mergers and acquisitions so sensitive?
   D. Its disclosures might violate SEC regulations
7. Who is the likeliest threat actor?
   A. An APT
8. Your team has confirmed that the initial attack vector targeted a zero-day vulnerability in your firewall. What should you do next?
   A. Notify the firewall vendor
9. Which of the following factors is most important in determining the impact of the incident?
   C. Data integrity
   D. The attacker has been very stealthy and does not appear to have publicly released any of the harvested info. This points to an operation that is focused on surveillance rather than financial profit. Furthermore, the attacker does not appear to have modified or destroyed data or to have interfered with any critical processes. This means the best factor based on the information available is the amount of time it will take it will take you to recover from this incident.
10. In which of the following types of data is the attacker most likely interested?
   A. Payment Card Information
   C. The attacker does not appear to be motivated by monetary profits, so credit card information is unlikely to be the goal. Similarly, the fact the attack appears to have started before the acquisition makes it less likely that the merger and acquisition information was targetd. Though it is possible that the atatcker is after IP regarding the cancer treatments, it is more likely that an APT would be interested in PII and/or PHI about prominent world figures.
